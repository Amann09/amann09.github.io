Real-Time: Parking Spot Detection System

- Parking Spot Detection System identifies the availability of parking spots in real-time.
- It achieves this by analyzing the difference between consecutive frames and uses a pre-defined mask to isolate parking spots.
- It reads video data from a specified file, processes each frame, and calculates the difference between frames to detect changes in parking spot occupancy.
- Implementation can be found on [GitHub â†—](https://github.com/Amann09/CV-Projects/tree/main/Parking%20Spot%20Detection).

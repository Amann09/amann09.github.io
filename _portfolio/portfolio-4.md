Rock Paper Scissors Classifier system using MobileNet V2 CNN architecture.

- The model is capable of discerning and categorizing hand gestures into rock, paper, or scissors by analyzing images. The system accomplishes this through the use of deep learning techniques, utilizing MobileNet V2's pre-trained features to identify key patterns in the images.

- This enables the model to make accurate predictions based on input images, delivering a robust classification solution for the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

- Implementation can be found on [GitHub â†—](https://github.com/Amann09/CV-Projects/tree/main/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors%20Classification%20using%20MobileNet%20V2).

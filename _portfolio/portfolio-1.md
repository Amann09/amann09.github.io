### Denoising and Inpainting of corrupted images using only architectural priors.

-  Implemented [Deep Image Prior ↗](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10925) research paper using U-Net, a deep learning architecture, enabling single-image restoration without a training dataset.

- Demonstrated the model on real and synthetic images, achieving high-quality restoration.

- Implementation can be found on [GitHub ↗](https://github.com/Amann09/U_Net_Arch_Deep_Image_Prior).

A Self-Driving Car Steering Simulator built using Udacity Car Simulator.

- It consists of 4 convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes, followed by 3 fully connected layers.

- The output layer has a single unit, and the model is compiled with the mean squared error loss and Adam optimizer for regression tasks.
